# MarGo

This project is the next step in the evolution of https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime...
this time with less Python, less Sublime Text and more Go.

### Warning

It is under very active experimental development and code may be broken or deleted at any time.

We appreciate your contributions! Please refer to [this](./CONTRIBUTE.md)
